# search-backend
A search engine backend, which indexes pages, produces rapid query results, and supports Google's initial PageRank algorithm (completed as a final project for a course at Brown University).

In order to respect Brown's academic code, this is simply a placeholder repository without my actual code. If you're interested in looking at this code, feel free to reach out to me at karan_kashyap@brown.edu
